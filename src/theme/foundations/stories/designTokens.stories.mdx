# How to use Design Tokens

The most fundamental parts of a design system are the so-called design tokens.
They are the colors, spacings and other styles we restrict ourselves to use that make out the look and feel of the design system.

With Chakra we can easily define a set of design tokens that can then be used in all our components.
It even comes with a [default theme](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/theme) which we have overwritten with the Volocopter design tokens.

## Using Design Tokens

It's straightforward that you are able to use the `colors` design tokens for the `color` property.
For everything else, you can take a look at this [overview of the style props](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/style-props).
It maps each Chakra component prop to the CSS property used under the hood and the theme key it references.

## Modifying Design Tokens

Please be aware that adding a design token is easy, but removing it again is very hard.
If you have to remove a design token, make sure that it is not used anywhere in the design system library and in all packages that use it.

## Generating Token Typings

In order to have TypeScript support for our styles, we can (and should) generate the token typings for our Chakra theme.
This usually happens automatically in the postinstall-script of the design system.
If token names have changed, tokens were added or removed, you need to regenerate the types to get proper TypeScript support.
For this you can run `yarn gen:theme-typings` directly.

## What Design Tokens are there?

Below you'll find a list of the design tokens defined and hints how to use them.

### Breakpoints

Instead of mediaQueries, we can provide object values to specify breakpoints,
as described in the [Chakra Documentation: Responsive Styles](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/responsive-styles).
Please prefer the object notation over the array notation because it is more readable and robust.
E.g. to change the fontSize depending on the screen size, you can write

```tsx
// e.g. src/theme/components/Component.ts
const styles = (props: ChakraProps) => {
    fontSize: { base: "sm", lg: "md" },
}

// e.g. src/components/Component.tsx
<Text fontSize={{ base: "sm", lg: "md" }}>some text</Text>
```

which sets the default fontSize to `sm` but uses `md` for screensizes of size `lg` and bigger.
Check out the [Breakpoints story](?path=/story/design-tokens-breakpoints--overview) to learn how to configure the preview size in storybook.

### Colors

These colors can be referenced by the `color`, `borderColor`, `backgroundColor`, `fill` and `stroke` properties,
see [Chakra Style Props: Color and background Color](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/style-props#color-and-background-color).
You can use the colors shown in these stories to style your components:

-   [Brand Colors](/?path=/story/design-tokens-colors--brand-colors) - The Volocopter blues
-   [Monochrome](/?path=/story/design-tokens-colors--monochrome) - basic black, white and gray
-   [Signal Colors](/?path=/story/design-tokens-colors--signal-colors) - for highlighting error, warning and success events
-   [Differentiating Colors](/?path=/story/design-tokens-colors--differentiating-colors) - e.g. for graphs
-   [Colors with Transparencies](/?path=/story/design-tokens-colors--colors-with-transparencies) - colors with alpha values

#### Theming

Providing our UIs in dark and light mode is an important UX requirement, so whenever you use colors, make sure to consider both color modes.
You can switch between a light-mode-color and a dark-mode-color by using the `mode` utility from `@chakra-ui/theme-tools` in the component's theme style file
or the [useColorModeValue](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/color-mode#usecolormodevalue) hook directly in the component:

```tsx
// e.g. src/theme/components/Component.ts
const styles = {
    color: mode("blue.500", "white")(props),
};

// e.g. src/components/Component.tsx
const color = useColorModeValue("blue.500", "white");
```

### Border Radii

Can be referenced by any prop with `radius` in it, see [Chakra Style Props: Border Radius](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/style-props#border-radius).

Check out the [Border radius story](?path=/story/design-tokens-border-radius--overview) to see our border radius tokens.

### Shadows

Can be referenced by the `textShadow`, `shadow`, and `boxShadow` properties, see [Chakra Style Props: Shadow](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/style-props#shadow).

Check out the [Shadows story](?path=/story/design-tokens-shadows--overview) to see our shadow tokens.

### Typography

The typography design tokens are comprised of tokens for `fontFamily`, `letterSpacing`, `lineHeight`, `fontWeight` and `fontSize`,
see [Chakra Style Props: Typography](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/style-props#typography).

You can view our typography tokens in their respective stories:

-   [Fonts](?path=/story/design-tokens-typography--fonts) - the font faces
-   [Letter Spacings](?path=/story/design-tokens-typography--letter-spacings) - amount of space between each letter
-   [Line Heights](?path=/story/design-tokens-typography--line-heights) - the amount of space above and below inline elements
-   [Font Weights](?path=/story/design-tokens-typography--font-weights) - weight/thickness of the font
-   [Font Sizes](?path=/story/design-tokens-typography--font-sizes) - size/height of the font

The `<Heading>` and `<Text>` components are already configured to use the tokens according to their specifications.
Normally, you should not use these tokens directly outside the Design System library, but use a predefined `<Text>` variant.
If you notice a missing variant, please add it!
